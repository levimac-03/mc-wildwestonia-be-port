Welcome to the **<span style="color:red;">Wildwestonia - Lost City</span>** port. This repository features the mysterious and adventurous world of Wildwestonia, originally crafted for Java Edition, now available on Bedrock Edition.

## How The Conversion Was Achieved

This conversion was successfully completed using **Amulet V0.10.35** to ensure compatibility with Bedrock Edition. The version ported is **Wildwestonia v1.0**, the latest release. To learn more about the tool, visit [Amulet's official website](https://www.amuletmc.com/).

## Why Use Amulet?

Amulet was chosen instead of JE2BE for several key reasons:

- **Chunk-Level Customization:** Essential for managing the detailed and expansive terrain of Wildwestonia.
- **Entity Preservation:** Ensures the proper transfer of entities and tile entities during conversion.
- **NBT Support:** Maintains all critical map attributes throughout the process.

While JE2BE is useful for basic conversions, Amulet provides the depth and control required for a complex map like Wildwestonia.
